> Plan for Smart Services‚Äù (P2S) Web-Application. P2S is an online system that aims to plan for smart green trips inside the city and its neighborhood through sharing vehicles (like Uber). Considering the traffic as a serious threat to the quality of life these years, the world has been looking for various solutions to decrease the stress, frustration, delays and terrible air pollutions being caused through it.
